        ePro-Aggregator is a web-app that collects data from the ePro completed
        PR Masterlists from field offices and then consolidate them to enable PALM managers to run
        aggregate reports on the consolidated data.
    </p>
    <p>
        ePro-Aggregator does not require field teams to re-enter the data; instead, it
        plugs into their existing workflows to get the data automatically. ePro-Aggregator
        integrates with Google Drive and Dropbox so when field teams store their PR masterlists
        on these platforms, they make their data accessible to ePro-Aggregator via backend API calls.
        However, an initial authorization needs to be granted for this process to work.
